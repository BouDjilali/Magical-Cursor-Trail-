Magical Cursor Trail ✨

This is a simple animation project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
As you move your mouse, colorful icons appear and float upward, creating a magical trail effect.

✅ Concepts I practiced while building this project:

Using event listeners (mousemove) in JavaScript

Creating and styling elements dynamically with createElement

Applying CSS animations (@keyframes)

Combining transform, opacity, and filter for smooth effects

This is a small practice project I made while learning web development, and I added it to my portfolio as an example of interactive animations.
